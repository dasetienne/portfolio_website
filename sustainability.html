			<p>Today, we humans are eating away at our own life support systems at an unprecedented rate. What’s more, we are living in turbulent political times across the globe. Politics is broken and business-as-usual is taking us in the wrong direction. But what can be done?</p>

			<p>Escaping old ideas, as Keynes said, is difficult. When ideas and concepts that benefit or represent one powerful group of people at the expense of the majority are universalised, they become the norms that shape our thinking: they become what’s ‘common sense’ and ‘natural’. We end up accepting a simplistic and beguiling mantra: more growth, more profits, more stuff. And, with it, the consequences: more climate change, more chaos, more extinction, more inequality. Create enough zeroes in the right places and you can make a desert and still call it progress. Meanwhile, the real stuff of life – the quality of the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe and the landscapes we live in – is often dismissed as the niche concerns of naïve and privileged idealists. This is where we are now.</p>

			<p>But why is social change fundamental to tackling issues, such as climate change? Climate change is not about diplomacy or energy or capital or economics. Climate change, like many other important issues, is about power. A new energy system means new power relations.</p>

			<p>We know how we can prevent the worst of climate change, rejuvenate soils, protect fish stocks. We know how we can create a more just society, how to build a better education system, give people clean water, provide human rights for all. These are not mysteries. We have the technology and the ability and the knowledge. What we are lacking is the will to make real political and social change.</p>

			<p>The only thing that will instigate that change is if enough of us are willing and have the courage to act together to build a more sustainable world.</p>

			<p>We must create more visionary global institutions to tackle climate change and the wider environmental crisis. Only a global agreement that provides an effective mechanism for sharing the costs of reducing emissions fairly between the world's countries - as well as cushioning the most vulnerable against the climate impacts that are already inevitable - will work. And that will only happen if we make it happen from the ground up.</p>

			<p>Our planet may be the only place in the universe where life exists. It is a precious thing, and it must be protected and nurtured, not torn apart for the short-term gain of a few. Humans are a force of nature, but we are a conscious force and we can use our power for good. We are not spectators, we are players, and we can shape the game, all of us together. It is time for all of us to see humanity for what it is: as a single species, interdependent on other species and the one, finite and beautiful planet we live on.</p>
